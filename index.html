                    <li>Malware <br>Malware — or malicious software — is any program or code that is created with the intent to do harm to a computer, network or server. Malware is the most common type of cyberattack, mostly because this term encompasses many subsets such as ransomware, trojans, spyware, viruses, worms, keyloggers, bots, cryptojacking, and any other type of malware attack that leverages software in a malicious way  </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>DOS Attack  <br>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a malicious, targeted attack that floods a network with false requests in order to disrupt business operations.

                    In a DoS attack, users are unable to perform routine and necessary tasks, such as accessing email, websites, online accounts or other resources that are operated by a compromised computer or network. While most DoS attacks do not result in lost data and are typically resolved without paying a ransom, they cost the organization time, money and other resources in order to restore critical business operations.  </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Phishing <br>Phishing is a type of cyberattack that uses email, SMS, phone, social media, and social engineering techniques to entice a victim to share sensitive information — such as passwords or account numbers — or to download a malicious file that will install viruses on their computer or phone.  </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Spoofing  <br>Spoofing is a technique through which a cybercriminal disguises themselves as a known or trusted source. In so doing, the adversary is able to engage with the target and access their systems or devices with the ultimate goal of stealing information, extorting money or installing malware or other harmful software on the device.  </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Identity-based Attacks <br> Identity-driven attacks are extremely hard to detect. When a valid user’s credentials have been compromised and an adversary is masquerading as that user, it is often very difficult to differentiate between the user’s typical behavior and that of the hacker using traditional security measures and tools.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Code Injection Attacks <br>Code injection attacks consist of an attacker injecting malicious code into a vulnerable computer or network to change its course of action.  </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Supply Chain Attacks <br> A supply chain attack is a type of cyberattack that targets a trusted third-party vendor who offers services or software vital to the supply chain. Software supply chain attacks inject malicious code into an application in order to infect all users of an app, while hardware supply chain attacks compromise physical components for the same purpose. Software supply chains are particularly vulnerable because modern software is not written from scratch: rather, it involves many off-the-shelf components, such as third-party APIs, open source code and proprietary code from software vendors. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Insider Threats <br> A supply chain attack is a type of cyberattack that targets a trusted third-party vendor who offers services or software vital to the supply chain. Software supply chain attacks inject malicious code into an application in order to infect all users of an app, while hardware supply chain attacks compromise physical components for the same purpose. Software supply chains are particularly vulnerable because modern software is not written from scratch: rather, it involves many off-the-shelf components, such as third-party APIs, open source code and proprietary code from software vendors. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> DNS Tunneling <br>DNS Tunneling is a type of cyberattack that leverages domain name system (DNS) queries and responses to bypass traditional security measures and transmit data and code within the network. Once infected, the hacker can freely engage in command-and-control activities. This tunnel gives the hacker a route to unleash malware and/or to extract data, IP or other sensitive information by encoding it bit by bit in a series of DNS responses.  </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>IoT Attacks  <br>An IoT attack is any cyberattack that targets an Internet of Things (IoT) device or network. Once compromised, the hacker can assume control of the device, steal data, or join a group of infected devices to create a botnet to launch DoS or DDoS attacks.  </li>

                    <li> Get the latest anti-virus and firewall software <br> Download updates regularly to make sure you’re protected against any new online threats. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Update your internet browser<br>The latest versions have built-in protection against fake websites and viruses.   </li>

                    <li> Create a strong and easy-to-remember password<br>Passwords that combine letters and numbers are generally harder to guess.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Use a different password for other services, or use a strong password<br>You should have a unique password for your different accounts. Make sure to use a combination of lower case and upper case letters,symbols and numbers so your password is strong. Also ensure it is over 8 characters long.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Change your password on a regular basis<br>It's a good idea to change your password every month</li>

                    <li> Never share your password <br>Never share your passwords online or in person. It could be a security breach. Ebnsure that you only use it on the official websites or apps of associated services/organisations</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Don't let your browser remember your log on details<br>It's much safer to re-enter your details every time you log on, even if it takes slightly longer. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Have 2 factor authentication<br> If manageable, set up 2 factor authentication using a verified authenticator app, your email address or phone number </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Learn to spot fake emails and websites<br>Criminals use them to con people into giving away passwords and bank details – the technical word is ‘phishing’.*More about that later*</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Avoid online fraud and con tricks<br> To protect yourself and your money on the internet, look out for deals that look too good to be true. </li>
